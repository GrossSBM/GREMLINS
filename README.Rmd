The goal of GREMLIN is to perform statistical analysis of multipartite networks through a block model approach. 

Multipartite networks  consist in the joint observation of several networks implying some common individuals. The individuals (or entities represented by nodes)  at stake are partitioned into groups defined by their nature.
In what follows, these groups will be referred to as  \emph{functional groups}.


## Installation

You can install the released version of GREMLIN [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#devtools::install_github("Demiperimetre/GREMLIN")
library(GREMLIN)
```

## Mathematical Background

###  A collection of networks

Assume that $Q$ functional groups of individuals are at stake; Let $n_q$ be  the number of individuals  in the $q$-th functional group.

A multipartite network is a collection of networks:  each network may be simple (relations inside  a   functional   group)   or bipartite  (relations between individuals of two  functional groups). We index the collection of networks by pairs of functional groups $(q,q')$. 

The set $E$ denotes  the  list of pairs of  functional groups  for   which we observe an interaction network.

For any pair $(q,q') \in E$, the interaction network is encoded in a matrix  $X^{qq'}$  :  $X^{qq'}_{ii'} \neq 0 $ if there is an edge from unit $i$ of functional group
$q$ to unit $i'$ of functional group $q'$, $0$ otherwise.
    - If $q \neq q'$,   $X^{qq'}$ is  said to be  an \emph{incidence matrix}.
    - $X^{qq}$ is  an \emph{adjacency matrix}:   it is symmetric if the relation inside the functional group $q$  is non-oriented, non-symmetric otherwise.

### A block model


Assume that,   each functional group $q$  is  divided into $K_q$  blocks (or equivalently clusters).  $\forall q\in \{1,\ldots,Q\}$ and  $ \forall i \in \{1,\ldots,n_q\}$, let $Z^{q}_i$ be
the latent random variable  such that $Z^ q_i =k$  if individual $i$ of functional group $q$ belongs to cluster $k$.
The random variables $Z^{q}_i$'s are assumed to be independent and  such that: $\forall k \in \{1,\ldots,K_q\}, \forall q \in \{1,\ldots,Q\}, \forall i \in \{1,\ldots,n_q\}$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mod2}
\Prob(Z^{q}_i=k) = \pi^{q}_k,
\end{equation}
with $\sum_{k=1}^{K_q}\pi^{q}_k=1$,  $\forall q \in \{1,\ldots,Q\}$.
Let $\bZ = \left(Z^{q}_i\right)_{i\in \{1,\ldots,n_q\}, q \in \{1,\ldots,Q\}}$ denote the set of latent variables.
